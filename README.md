:point_right: Funny animated hanging man

</br>

### :world_map: App Demonstration
</br>
By the time the window appears it will be displayed the dynamic keyboard, the blank spaces corresponding to the random word and the life count display which will also be represented by the hanger animation. It is ready to play and have fun!

As you click a letter it will replace the corresponding blank space in case it is included among the letters of the words. Otherwise, you will lose a life and a part of the hangman's body will so be hanged.

</h4>

There are six lives at most. The life counter will decrease at every mistake and will be represented by a body part hanged.

As soon as all body parts have been hanged it means you have lost the game. On the other hand, if you guessed all letters from the secret word it means you have won it! In both cases a message box will pop up and the keyboard will be locked until the "New Word" (Nova Palavra) Button is pressed.

### :floppy_disk: Installation

Download this repository by navigating to the top level of the project and then a green "Code" download button will be visible on the right. Choose the Download ZIP option from the Code pull-down menu. That ZIP file will contain the entire repository content.

To run the desktop app just double click on "hangman.exe" created with PyInstaller. Probably the antivirus program will see it as suspicious and naturally will run a scan. As soon as the scan is finished it will start the main window. It is then ready to play and have fun!

#### - Cloning From Terminal

Assuming the system has _git_ installed, open windows command prompt by typing "cmd" in searchbar.

Type then

''' bash
$ git clone https://github.com/e-moncao-lima/hangman-app.git
'''

And then run "hangman.exe" and have some fun!
